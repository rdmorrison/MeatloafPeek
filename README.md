# MeatloafPeek
NET tool for interfacing with the Meatloaf C64 WiFi device   - this is not great or efficient code, I was playing around for fun.  A trial/test to see where I wanted to end up.
I used VS community version 2022 - and started throwing ideas at the wall, and like a Jackson Pollock painting, there is a beautiful sense of choas. 
The real meatloaf project is https://github.com/idolpx/meatloaf  and meatloaf.cc   << I am just tcp connecting and issue command for now.
now I have chickened out LOL
